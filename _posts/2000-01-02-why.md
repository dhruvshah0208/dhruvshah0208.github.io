## I am currently a first year undergraduate at IIT Bombay doing a B.Tech in Engineering Physics.
## You can find the list of the courses I have taken and am taking [here](gonna put a  link here). You can find my weekly schedule [here](gonna put a link here)
## I am a math and physics enthusiast and am currently working as a convener in the [Math and Physics Club, IIT Bombay](http://mnp-club.github.io/)
## I also love music and play the keyboard and also produce music using FL Studio 20 as my DAW. You can find my creations [here](https://soundcloud.com/dfr-music) (this doesn't include my latest work since that is to be part of a big project which will hopefully come out soon)
