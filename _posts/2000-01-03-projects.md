        <div class="custom-column-content">
          <p>This was the subject I took for the Summer of Science 2020 initiative of the MnP Club IIT Bombay. You can find my report <a href="https://github.com/mahadevans2432/Quantum-Information-and-Computing-SoS-2020">here</a>. I also took part in the IBM Quantum Challenge and got to learn how to use qiskit and was able to complete the challenge. You can find my repository for it <a href="https://github.com/mahadevans2432/IBM-Quantum-Challenge">here</a>.

        <div class="custom-column-content">
          <p>This is an ongoing project which I am doing under <a href="http://ether.chem.iitb.ac.in/people/Faculty/prof/ajain.html">Prof. Amber Jain</a> as the Summer Undergraduate Research Project. We are currently reading literature concerning different interpretations of quantum mechanics including Bohmian Mechanics and the Many Worlds Interpretation and also some interesting gedanken experiments which propose a method for differentiating between these interpretations in terms of measurement situations.

        <div class="custom-column-header">Neural Network for identifying diseases in apple leaves</div>
        <div class="custom-column-content">
          <p>This is the ongoing project for the Institute Technical Summer Project in which our team is building a tensorflow model which would look at a dataset of images of the leaves of apple trees. The model is built using transfer learning and we also used image augmentation. This was actually part of a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7/overview">kaggle competition</a> and we obtained our data from there. The teams repository is available <a href="https://github.com/Leaf-Scrutiny-Department">here</a> and this is the <a href="https://leafscrutinydepartment-test.herokuapp.com/">website of the project</a>.
