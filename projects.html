I developed numerical simulations for creating coupling between superconducting transmons using fixed capacitive coupling and a tunable coupling scheme involving mediated coupling with a transmon. I also studied properties of the family of gates generated by this scheme which only couples |01⟩ to |10⟩ and |12⟩ to |21⟩ for qutrits for rotating wave approximation, hence ratio of the couplings are important. Keeping this mind I conducted a bound optimization of circuit parameters to enable complete idling of 2-qutrit operations in the tunable scheme and demonstrated that for coupling ratios of 1.5 and 2, one can construct expressible ansatzes with nearly equal performance to qutrit CZ in the same ansatzes for obtaining arbitrary unitaries. We are currently working toward involving parametric coupling into the setup for using non-tunable qudits but a tunable transmon for coupling.

In this project, we have constructed an ansatz which aims to solve the task of distinguishing between two quantum channels where the probe state is variationally optimized to maximize trace distance between the two different states obtained from the two quantum channels. The trace distance itself is calculated using a variational circuit which only needs single qubit measurements. I also studied the various links between the task of state discrimination in relation to relative entropy, Chernoff bound, Helstrom bound and the quantum fisher information hence justifying choosing trace distance as a cost function. In addition, I encoded the quantum illumination problem and optimized the probe for hypothesis testing which gave close to the ideal performance achieved by the two-mode squeezed vacuum state.

We conceptualized a solid state spintronic setup for the detection of magnetic fields that uses weak value amplification which is a result of using the energy channels that can do resonant tunneling. I performed simulations using the Keldysh (NEGF) method to benchmark the signal which the setup gives and observed noticeable signatures for the resonant tunneling energy values of the barrier setup. I also analytically derived the quantum fisher information for the sensing task and compared with the classical fisher information from measurements and observed that classical fisher information almost approaches quantum fisher information at the resonant states.

In this project, we proposed a method for generating higher moments of Hermitian operators which uses block encoding into larger dimension unitaries. I demonstrated that to get efficiently higher moments of a Hermitian operator given a block encoding of it we can use ququarts since we need arbitrary controlled n-qubit unitaries, which have been realized using ququarts with O(n) overhead in operations. I also studied quantum error correction theory for qudits which allow for certain optimal codes not possible in qubits and analyzed concatenation success probabilities for the 5-qubit code and an encoding for qudits.

The main aim of this project is to be able to do coherent state population transfer in Rubidium 87 making use of a 4 level cavity STIRAP to be able to emit photons finally from a cavity. QuTip, SciPy ad NumPy were used for all the simulations and I built a framework which was capable of simulating N-STIRAP and cavity-STIRAP. We were able to achieve a transfer with blackman pulses of peaks 100 MHz and 10 MHz with an efficiency of 99.5% with a single photon detuning of 1 GHz and a two photon detuning of 2.18 MHz and timescale 25 &#181s.

We were given data of proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV that was generated using the Pythia 8 Generator and using the transverse momentum data we found the variation of higher moments of averaged transverse momentum as we vary multiplicity classes. Cern's ROOT was used for the data analysis and you can find the macros in the linked code repository.

We read literature concerning different interpretations of quantum mechanics including Bohmian Mechanics and the Many Worlds Interpretation and objective collapse theories and also some interesting gedanken experiments which propose breaking points of these interpretations.

                        <p>This is a project for the Institute Technical Summer Project in which our team has built a tensorflow model which would look at a dataset of images of the leaves of apple trees. The model is built using transfer learning and we also used image augmentation. This was actually part of a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7/overview" class="links">kaggle competition</a> and we obtained our data from there.
